MediGene: A Telehealth Application 

The post-pandemic world has redefined the way we live, work, and access essential services—especially healthcare. With people increasingly confined to remote locations, the demand for quick, affordable, and reliable healthcare has never been greater. The need of the hour is a seamless, digitally enabled solution that bridges the gap between patients and healthcare providers, ensuring quality care from anywhere in the world. Today, we present a Telehealth application designed to address these critical challenges by offering:
Instant access to health consultations with an experience mirroring in-person visits.
Efficient patient onboarding, capturing essential details and specialty needs upfront. 
Secure payment processing before consultations to ensure a smooth experience.  
Strict privacy compliance for Protected Health Information (PHI), with secure data storage for future reference.  Real-time chat functionality to enhance communication during consultations.
